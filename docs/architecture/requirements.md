# Architectural Drivers / Architectural Significant Requirements
*This requirement document is based on a template that me (Tobias Fremming) and Sverre Nystad made in Cogito in order to make it easier to define architectural drivers in the organization, based on the curriculum in the course Software Architecture TDT4240.*

This document presents the key architectural drivers and significant requirements for the VR4Vet chatbot system developed in IT2901-11 during spring 2025. It includes functional and non-functional (quality) requirements shape the system’s behavior, performance, and operational attributes in order to ensure that the needs of its end users and stakeholders are met, while maintaining a high quality standard.


## Functional Requirements
*Functional requirements specify the exact behaviors, actions, and functionalities the chatbot system must provide. They detail the operations the system must perform under various conditions and outline the services it must deliver.*

The functional requirements are divided into three different priorities: 

- **High Priority** - Essential for core system functionality; without these, the system’s ability to deliver a satisfactory experience is significantly compromised.
- **Medium Priority** - Important for system functionality but not critical; the system can still operate without them.
- **Low Priority** - Non-essential but desirable features that enhance the user experience without affecting core functionality.

The functional requirements are listed below:
