Salmon lead an extraordinary life filled with dramatic journeys and transformations. Their story begins in freshwater streams, where a female salmon carefully deposits her eggs in nests called "redds," hidden beneath gravel. Once the eggs hatch, the young salmon, known as alevins, remain sheltered while they feed off their yolk sacs. As they grow, they transition into fry and then develop into parr, marked by stripes that help camouflage them in the river environment.

When the time is right, these parr undergo a crucial transformation into smolts—a stage where they adapt to saltwater by undergoing physiological changes. This prepares them for the vast ocean, where they embark on a life of feeding, growing, and maturing. In the ocean, salmon take advantage of abundant food resources, which helps them build the strength and energy needed for their remarkable return journey.

Guided by an innate instinct, mature salmon eventually leave the ocean to navigate back to the very streams where they were born. This migration is both challenging and perilous, as they overcome obstacles like strong currents and predators. Finally, in a dramatic culmination of their life cycle, they arrive to spawn, releasing their eggs and ensuring the continuation of their species before their life comes to an end.

The life of a salmon is a testament to nature’s resilience and the incredible instinct that drives these fish to complete one of the most arduous migrations in the animal kingdom.
